## A mechanical approach to control pressure in LAMMPS simulations

*by Yawei Liu  @Sydney, Australia 2021/03/07*

In our studies on surface nanobubbles [1] and diffusio-osmotic flow [2], we often use a simulation box which contains a horizontal fluid-solid interfaces, and we often need to control the pressure in the fluid [see Fig.1]. A very straightforward method to do this is putting a top wall in the system and then applying an external force on the top wall. The total force imposed on the top wall $F=-p\cdot L_x L_y$ with $p$ the target pressure, $L_x$ and $L_y$ the dimensions of the simulation box in $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively ($-$ means a positive pressure imposes a force in the $-z$-direction). During the simulations, the top wall moves as a rigid body, keeping fluctuating and acting as the controller to maintain a constant pressure in the fluid.

Here is the LAMMPS script of using such a mechanical approach to control the pressure in the system as shown in Fig.1.

In this script, the total force $F$ is divided by the number of particles in the top wall, and then these per-atom forces are imposed on each particles in the top wall via the ```aveforce``` command so that the top wall will move as a rigid body during the simulation (note that the initial velocity of particles in top wall is zero).

We also compute the local pressure to confirm the mechanical approach is valid in the simulations. This is done by using ```compute stress/atom```, ```compute chunk/atom``` and ```fix ave/chunk``` in the LAMMPS script. The computed results are written into the file named *press.log*. The local pressure $p=-c\_stress[3]\cdot density$. Figure 2 shows the computed local pressure as a function of $z$. We can see in the bulk region, the local pressure is equal to the target pressure we set, indicating the mechanical approach is valid. Note that near the wall, i.e., in the interface region, the local pressure departures from the target value due to the surface tension effect. However, if we compute the local pressure in $z$-direction using the Irvingâ€“Kirkwood method, we can obtain that even in the interface region, the local $z$-component pressure is also equal to the target value [see Ref.[2] for details].
